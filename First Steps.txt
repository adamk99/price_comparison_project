~later~
How to combine our python section of the project with SQL and a database? (replace excel part with an actual database)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Task List
Create github repository
Research and experiment:
How to create and use JSON/SQL databases
Source code for applications with price comparisons
How to utilize python to pull information into JSON/SQL databases

Protype, mockup, and framework for project
Create a flowchart for how the application will work (pull info -> storing info -> comparing prices -> etc.)
Create a flowchart for how users will interact with our program
Create prototypes for code

Create database of items we want to check/ items with price in each store(json, sql, excel)(store - include item name, price, SKU number, date and time, link)
How to add items to a chart/database through code
Pull items to database
Price comparison between databases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. learn how to create databases (learn SQL)
    - create one together, create a standard for format
    - create others
2. create comparison operator between databases (python to compare json files?)
    - test with hand populated random databases
3. create tool to auto populate databases with data based off of SKU number, price, w/e (splice strings from websites/ webscraping to find prices and item details)

for ex:
#1 database for items we would like to look at and compare prices for
#2, #3 databases for stores (target, walmart, amazon, ebay, w/e)

use #1 as a list of items we want to specifically look at
use #2, #3 to list item details
